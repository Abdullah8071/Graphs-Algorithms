# Graphs-Algorithms

In this Project, we examined different graph algorithms. We implemented Prims,Kruksal, Dijkstra, Bellman ford as well as Floyd Warshall Algorithm.
We used python as the programming language and used Tkinter for GUI interface. We tested our algorithms on the given Benchmarks.
Introduction
The purpose of this project was to implement the graph algorithms that we were taught in the Algorithms course and to make GUI interface which is easy to use and also provides proper visualization for all graph algorithms. 


Experimental Setup

The input to our system is a .txt file which provides the information regarding the number of nodes in the graph and the edges of the graph. The format of the .txt file is same as that given in the benchmark files.



Results and Discussion

We ran our algorithms on the given benchmarks and obtained the following results

Conclusion
In this project we demonstrated our proficiency in implementing graph algorithms by implementing all the graph algorithms that we learned in our course. We also provided a neat GUI and visualized the various graph algorithms.
